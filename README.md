## Project Overview
User authentication base code that uses hashing and salt and doesn't send any sensitive data through the browser.


## Technologies:
- MERN
- HTML
- Javascript
- MongoDB
- Nodejs
  
    
## Project Description:
The login system passwords are hashed with salt on the server end. Bare-bones authentication system.

## Time to complete:
 2 Weeks

## Challenges:
For this project, I incorporated user authentication including input validation. I wanted to make sure password information stayed private and wasn't sent through the browser as raw data. Including a salt and hashing with sha-256 helped to accomplish this.
